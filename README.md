# Price Estimator Tool

This tool is meant to help customers effectively price their vehicles. It combines information about what the vehicles current 'worth' is, along with data about the likelihood at selling at different price points, as well as historical trends for the vehicle and the broader market performance to understand the costs associated with not selling the vehicle quickly (depreciation metrics). I am using sample data as production data is sensitive and proprietary. This is meant to illustrate, in principle, how this kind of data can be utilized in a front-end interface.
